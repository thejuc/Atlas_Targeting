Step 4: Click Set Origin. Place a point where you want the origin to be set.
Step 5: Click Line. This will allow you to draw a line and will output the length and angle. 

To add more lines: click line and draw another line.

To see line endpoint coordinates: Click on the line of interest, it will display coordinates below the image (origin must be set!)

To move lines with arrow keys: Click on the line of interest, use arrow keys to navigate.

To set precise length and angle: Click on the line of interest, change value of angle/length. Click enter.
